# To dev locally:

## To build the docker:

docker build -t shlab-ubuntu .

## to run the docker:

docker run -it -v $(pwd):/shlab shlab-ubuntu

## add docker to path:

export PATH="/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin:$PATH"

# Stop all containers

docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all stopped containers

docker container prune -f

# Now delete the image

docker rmi shlab-ubuntu

# Rebuild

docker build -t shlab-ubuntu .

Files:

Makefile # Compiles your shell program and runs the tests
README # This file
tsh.c # The shell program that you will write and hand in
tshref # The reference shell binary.

# The remaining files are used to test your shell

sdriver.pl # The trace-driven shell driver
trace\*.txt # The 15 trace files that control the shell driver
tshref.out # Example output of the reference shell on all 15 traces

# Little C programs that are called by the trace files

myspin.c # Takes argument <n> and spins for <n> seconds
mysplit.c # Forks a child that spins for <n> seconds
mystop.c # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself
myint.c # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGINT to itself

# Solution idea

First knockoff the quit case. Follow the order of the trace files. To test correctness of implementation, to run reference solution use `make rtest09`. To run your solution, use `make test09` and compare outputs. You can also run solution interactively using `make` and then do `./tsh`.
